When row number goes high, performance get worse very quickly. The Method of using [][]string with sync.Pool on the other hand, needs smallest number of memory allocation, and compare to the one without sync.Pool, and because memory allocation takes significant amount of time, it’s still faster.

To get the actual data, we need to do these steps: Partition the data table dbData by key_id, Rank it by timestamp (DESC), get the rank=1 datas from dbData Join dbKey and dbData back togetter. Here’s the query: SELECT dbKey.*, finalDBData.* FROM dbKey, ( SELECT *, rank() OVER (PARTITION BY key_id ORDER BY TIMESTAMP DESC) AS rank FROM dbData where \"timestamp\" \u003c= 101) finalDBData where dbKey.project_id = 10 and rank =1 and finalDBData.key_id = dbKey.id; Here’s the db\u003c\u003efiddle you can play with this query. We choose this design because it can save a lot of space to store every version of data. If version 2 has 10 keys, each key has 50 data, and if we change data under only 1 key, we only have to re-insert all data under this modified key. and only need to insert 50 data. Of course, this design has some limitations, but in this post, let’s focus on the PARTITION - SELECT query optimization.

The documentation stats that There are two fundamental restrictions on when this method can be used: The index type must support index-only scans. B-tree indexes always do. GiST and SP-GiST indexes support index-only scans for some operator classes but not others. Other index types have no support. The underlying requirement is that the index must physically store, or else be able to reconstruct, the original data value for each index entry. As a counterexample, GIN indexes cannot support index-only scans because each index entry typically holds only part of the original data value. The query must reference only columns stored in the index. For example, given an index on columns x and y of a table that also has a column z, these queries could use index-only scans: The first one is staicfied because we are using B-tree index. The second one can be satisfied by modifying our SQL query, We can build the mapping between key_id and the rank=1 timestamp first, WITH map AS ( SELECT key_id, timestamp FROM ( SELECT key_id, timestamp, rank() OVER (PARTITION BY key_id ORDER BY TIMESTAMP DESC) AS rank FROM dbData where \"timestamp\" \u003c= 10000 and key_id \u003c 100 ) sub WHERE rank = 1) SELECT * FROM map; Result will be like: key_id | timestamp --------+----------- 1 | 10000 2 | 300 3 | 6000 4 | 90303 and then, get actual data from dbData with specific key_id and timestamp pair. WITH map AS ( SELECT key_id, timestamp FROM ( SELECT key_id, timestamp, rank() OVER (PARTITION BY key_id ORDER BY TIMESTAMP DESC) AS rank FROM dbData where \"timestamp\" \u003c= 10000 and key_id \u003c 100 ) sub WHERE rank = 1) SELECT dbKey.*, dbData.* FROM dbKey INNER JOIN map m ON m.key_id = dbKey.id INNER JOIN dbData ON dbData.key_id = m.key_id AND m.timestamp = dbData.timestamp; The reason we build the map first is that the select list in map are all stored in the index, which satisfied requirement 2 in the documentation, and later when we query dbData , we can still have Index Scan.
